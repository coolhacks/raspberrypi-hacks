## What is Raspberry Pi ?

The Raspberry Pi is a series of credit cardâ€“sized single-board computers developed in England, United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.
The original Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi 2 are manufactured in several board configurations through licensed manufacturing agreements with Newark element14 (Premier Farnell), RS Components and Egoman.
The hardware is the same across all manufacturers.
